# Introduction
Blasting the unitigs from the HGAP assembly that some of the miseq reads mapped to in order to see if they are from Skeletonema or contaminants.

# Result
Four of the five unitigs where confirmed to be from Skeletonema, and one is of uknown origin. The latter is probably an intergenic region or part of the mitochondria/chloroplast.
